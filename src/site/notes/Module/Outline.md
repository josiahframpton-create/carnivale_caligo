In this campaign I would like to have the following happen:


## Overall Goals

This campaign will be a three parter that has the main goal of introducing a [[Locations/The Carnival/Carnivale Caligo\|carnival]] carnival that resembles The Carnival from [Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/vrgtr/the-carnival). This carnival will appear multiple times throughout my planned Campaign 2. It follows a specific route normally, but in the last few years as war has broken out in [[Locations/Virelia\|Virelia]], it has begun to travel erratically. Some towns it stops in have no money and leave the workers broke and desperate while others have strange customs that conflict with the carnival.

This is where we pick up in this story. The carnival has once again stopped in a [[Locations/Pittorille/Pittorille\|small town]] that doesn't seem to want it. The authorities have demanded they don’t set up and leave immediately, but the owner of the carnival refused and said let no one come if they aren’t welcome. It is now the second night that they are in this town and they are as busy as ever. But something is off. The people of this town seem to be ignorant of the [[Pantheons/Neoilesian Gods/Neoilesian Gods\|Neoilesian Gods]], and take pleasure in throwing things off at the shows, games, and rides.

# Session 1

This session is just to introduce the party (a group of workers at the carnival) and the main conflict.

- Any party members who have shows can briefly describe what they do, I will come up with strange behavior that would happen at that show.
- Have some sort of “muscle” or bouncer come around asking everyone to keep an eye on things. Fights have broken out, people are antagonizing performers, or they have purposefully destroyed a ride, etc.
- Introduce the presence of Zilévo by showing the ground open up creating a cult of the envious who attack someone who is weak at the carnival. (a fight breaks out with our heroes present and the carnival is only saved due to them, but someone dies in the process).
- Carny justice is imminent.

# Session 2

This session will start with a meeting between all of the workers of the carnival. It's time to have our justice since the people of the town won’t do anything!

  

- Carnival workers hold a meeting. Figure out what to do about the death of their family.
    
- They split up into groups to antagonize the town.
    
- The party explores the town to find lots of strange markings resembling a massive hole in the earth swallowing up everything in sight.
    
- The party finds some people so envious of their neighbors, the carnival, anything that they begin to attack and attempt to steal.
    
- Carnival decides it's time to go and packs up.
    
- The mists come in and the border is closed. No matter what the carnival does, they end up back at the fair grounds,with their equipment set back up and the town beginning to show up for another night of fun.
    

# Session3

This session is set up to find a way to clear Zilévo’s corruption from the town, kill Zilévo’s leaders, or find a way to leave. Each of these endings will be set up by choices made in session 1 and 2.
